\problem{2}

Chapter 1 of your text presents many definitions of statistics. How would you define statistics? Explain why this is your definition. Based on your definition, what role do you think mathematics plays in statistics?
\hrule

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Statistics is the quantitative study of data and distributions. It is about learning patterns that data follows and properties of the patterns.
	\item Mathematics is essential for providing a quantitative analysis. It provides tools for studying different properties of the distributions. 
\end{enumerate}

\problem{3}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item What issues did you encounter while working through the example code? If you did not encounter any issues please say so.
	\item Explain in your own words, how much experience you have had using R. Do you have concerns about executing code like that in these examples and the Real or Fake activity (aside from writing your own loops and apply functions) as we progress through class?
\end{enumerate}
\hrule

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item I had no issues. It was strange to give plots that fail in the example, but it shows what errors are like I suppose.
	
	\item I have had no experience using R (besides the example). I am a computer science major, so I have no problems executing+writing my own code. 

\end{enumerate}
