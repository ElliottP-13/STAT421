# Problem 1
## Statement

3.121 -  (clearly show steps to achieve a written probability statement,
then write the code you would use to find the probability in R/find probability using R)

Let Y denote a random variable that has a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda$ = 2. Find
1. P(Y = 4)
2. P(Y $\geq$ 4)
3. P(Y $<$ 4)
4. P(Y $\geq$ 4|Y $\geq$ 2)
\hrule

## Solution






# Problem 2
## Statement 

3.128

Cars arrive at a toll both according to a Poisson process with mean 80 cars per hour. If the
attendant makes a one-minute phone call, what is the probability that at least 1 car arrives
during the call?

## Solution









# Problem 3
## Statement 
First, run the example R code provided, then answer the following question. On the same
plotting region, plot the distribution of Y ~ Binomial(n, p) and W ~ Poisson(np)
for p = 0.1 and varying values of n. Create a maximum of 3 plots and explain what
you notice about Y and W as n $\to \infty$

# Extra Credit
## Statement

3.85

Find E(Y(Y-1)) for a geometric random variable Y by finding $\frac{d^2}{dq^2} (\sum_{y=1}^\infty q^y)$. Use this result to find the variance of Y.
